# LEGO_StableDiffusion
The project aim was to fine-tune stable diffusion model in order to generate images in the LEGO style based on the prompt.

To run app install requirements by typing: `pip3 install -r requirements`, then run the main app file `python3 app/main.py`, making sure you are in the root repo directory.

Database was created by our own by scraping the LEGO pictures.
